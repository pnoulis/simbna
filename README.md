## About the project

**Simbna** pronounced *simba*, (the n is silent) (just like the character from
Lion King) is sort for 'Simple build, not GNU Autotools'.

Simbna is an extremely rudimentary build "system" heavily influenced by the
software suite GNU Autotools and general GNU hacker culture.

[GNU Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html)

[GNU Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.71/autoconf.html)

[GNU Coding Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html)

It's focus is on small projects of any language that do not want to make use of
a full blown build system, have no need for it, or one does not even exist for
their language, but could do with some automation and standardization.

The author hopes that one might even enjoy the feeling one gets when their tool
is simple enough to be able to grasp it in whole. (for those of us with a small
brain!)
